Hard rules:
- Output ONLY a single JSON object. No prose before or after. No fences.
- Match the schema EXACTLY. Every required key must be present and well-typed.
- Tasks are ATOMIC — each task should edit ONE file and have a single concrete
  acceptance criterion. Decompose large work into many small tasks.
- Tasks have stable IDs: `T01-<slug>`, `T02-<slug>`, ... (two-digit zero-padded
  index, kebab-case slug, max 40 chars after the dash).
- `depends_on` lists IDs of tasks that must complete BEFORE this one. Use
  empty list for tasks with no prerequisite.
- `estimated_total_tasks` MUST equal the length of `tasks`.
- `project_name` MUST be lowercase kebab-case, starting with a letter.
- Do not invent fields. Do not nest extra structure. Do not add comments.
